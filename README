NAME
    LWP::UserAgent::Patch::Retry - Add retries

VERSION
    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
     use LWP::UserAgent::Patch::Retry -n => 2, -delay => 3;

DESCRIPTION
    This patch adds retries to LWP::UserAgent when response from request is
    not a success.

    Can be used with WWW::Mechanize because that module uses LWP::UserAgent.

CONFIGURATION
  -n => INT (default: 2)
    Number of retries. Default is 2, which means it will retry twice (so the
    total number of requests is 3).

  -delay => INT (default: 3)
    Delay between retries, in seconds.

  -criteria => CODE
    Specify custom criteria of whether to retry. Will be passed "($self,
    $response)" and should return 1 if retry should be performed. For
    example if you do not want to retry on 404 errors.

FAQ
  Why not subclass?
    By patching, you do not need to replace all the client code which uses
    LWP::UserAgent (or WWW::Mechanize, and so on).

TODO
    More complex retrying delays (exponential backoff).
